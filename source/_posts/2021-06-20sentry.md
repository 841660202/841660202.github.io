This is a quick getting started guide. For in-depth instructions on integrating Sentry with React, view [our complete documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/).

To instrument your React application with Sentry, first install the `@sentry/react` and `@sentry/tracing` packages:

```
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/react @sentry/tracing

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/react @sentry/tracing
```

Next, import and initialize the Sentry module as early as possible, before initializing React:

```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
import App from "./App";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://a5f1c39789b24bb7a434868b677e0c65@/1063",
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

// Can also use with React Concurrent Mode
// ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
```

The above configuration captures both error and performance data. To reduce the volume of performance data captured, change `tracesSampleRate` to a value between 0 and 1.

After this step, Sentry will report any uncaught exceptions triggered by your application.

You can trigger your first event from your development environment by raising an exception somewhere within your application. An example of this would be rendering a button whose `onClick` handler attempts to invoke a method that does not exist:

```
return <button onClick={methodDoesNotExist}>Break the world</button>;
```

Once you've verified the library is initialized properly and sent a test event, consider visiting our [complete React docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/). There you'll find additional instructions for surfacing valuable context from React error boundaries, React Router, Redux, and more.
